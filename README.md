# ðŸ§  notely-ai

notely-ai is a full-stack personal notes application designed to demonstrate clean architecture, modern development practices, and basic AI integration. The project emphasizes production-ready workflows with a focus on CI/CD pipelines, code quality, and developer experience. Built with Node.js (TypeScript), MongoDB, and a minimal React frontend, it offers a simple yet complete example of how to deliver maintainable and scalable backend APIs.
